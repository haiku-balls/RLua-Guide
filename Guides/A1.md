This page will go over basics that you will use every day when using RLua.
```lua
    -- Print something
    -- This will be visible in the output in Roblox Studio.
    -- Printing can be super useful for figuring out what's not working.
    print("hello!")

    -- Print something, but warning.
    -- This is the same as printing, but this time will be highlighed orange.
    warn("oh no!")
