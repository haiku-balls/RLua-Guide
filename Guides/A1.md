## Intro

This page will go over basics that you will use every day when using RLua.
To start create a script. In the explorer view, hover over "Workspace" and click the plus. Then click Script.

You can view the script anytime by double-clicking the script.

```lua
    -- Print something
    -- This will be visible in the output in Roblox Studio.
    -- Printing can be super useful for figuring out what's not working.
    print("hello!")

    -- Print something, but warning.
    -- This is the same as printing, but this time will be highlighed orange.
    warn("oh no!")

    -- Waiting. Extremely useful, will wait for a certain amount of time before doing something. 
    -- Will be used quite a lot.
    wait(2) -- Time in seconds (in-game: ticks)

    -- Variable. This can be a true-false, number, or even a string.
    -- Variables can't be named something roblox uses such as "function"

    -- Number
    local myVariable = 2

    -- Boolean (True-false)
    local myVarible2 = true

    -- String
    local myVarible3 = "hello"
```  
**Playtesting**  
To playtest. Press the play button located here.

To see your "printing" code work. Make sure to turn on the output.  
Click the View tab, and click Output.

The output should look something like this.

Now for some more code, this section will go over functions, conditions, loops, if-else statments, how the roblox file system works, and how to change parts.  
  
**Defining a function**  
Creating functions are extremely useful for doing tasks. For example, let's say you want to print something, warn, and then run a big 'ol function. Not only will functions make your code easier to read, but they can even in some cases be faster.
```lua
-- Your function can be called whatever you want. Make sure it's name is relevent to what it does.
local function myfunction()

end -- Remember to include "end" Roblox will usually auto-fill this for you anyway.
```
**Using functions**  
Calling a function will be needed to run your function or functions. The next examples will go over ways you can use functions.

```lua
-- Simple function. Make sure to call it.
local function mePrintSomething()
    print("Hello function.")
end

-- Calling a function is easy. You could even add a wait before calling it!
mePrintSomething()
```

```lua
-- Multiple functions. With some other code.
local function printSomething()
    print("This is my other function. Say hi!")
    wait(5)
    warn("I don't like functions.")
end

local function wow()
    print("Not very nice. :c")
end

wait(2)
printSomething() -- Call your functions.
wait(3)
print("Woah I called my function!")
wow()
```

**Conditions & Loops**  
Sometimes you don't want your code to simply run. Instead only run when you *need* it to.
Or even have it run a bunch of times.

```lua
...

-- Conditions

-- Let's assume we have a function to call named "doSomething"
local run = false

-- using the if statement will make your code only runs if the condition is met.
if run == false then -- Make sure when you want "is equal to" use double equals.
    doSomething()
end

-- If-else statement. Just like an if, but with an else.
if run == false then
    doSomething()
else -- Else will run if run is equal to anything OTHER than (for example) false.
    print("Run!")
end
```

```lua
-- Loops


-- Your loop can be conditional, or it can run forever.

-- A conditional loop.
-- This will only loop while run is equal to false.
while run == false do
    wait(0.1) -- See warning.
    doSomething()
end

-- WARNING: Running a loop without some level of wait will CRASH YOUR CLIENT.

-- Infinite loop
-- nil means nothing. This will run forever.
while nil = true do
    wait(2)
    print("Waiting on you!")
end

```

**Roblox File Structure**  
The way roblox handles folders, parts, children and parents is quite easy.  
For these examples, we'll be using a file structure as seen below.
![Image of roblox directory.](/RLua-Guide/img/roblox-dir.png)  
  
This file structure would be as follows.
```lua
game.Workspace.FolderA.FolderB.Script
```  
*Q: What is a child?*  
A: A child is a part, folder, or any other item that is inside something else. Example the script is a child of FolderB.  
*Q: What's a parent?*  
A: Similar to child. A parent is a part, folder, or any other item that has a child. Example FolderA is a parent of FolderB.

**Structures of properties**

```lua
-- As seen is the image above. Properties are the settings that make up most of roblox's items. Such as color, or Transparency.
-- Just like the previous example properties are called like folders.

game.Workspace.part.Color

```

**Changing properties**  
This example will use this structure. Make sure to make a part by clicking the plus on workspace. Same with folders. :)

Changing the part's color is simple.
```lua
-- You could use:
game.Workspace.FolderA.FolderB.Part.Color

-- Even better, you could use:
script.Parent.Part

-- Here are some more examples of structures.
script.Parent.Parent.FolderC.Part
game.Workspace.FolderE.FolderG.Part


-- So, to change a parts color we use.
wait(5)
script.Parent.Part.Color = Color3.new()

-- To choose a color. Click inside the ()s. Click the rainbow circle to choose a color. Once you choose one, roblox will fill the code for you.
```

I chose red as my color. Your part should be your color when you playtest.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65756037/132960223-894fc6a6-a0a4-4ab8-b1a8-ca3bdbc06cb4.png)

```lua
-- You can even use functions if you'd like. Multiple if you choose.
local function MakePartRed()
    script.Parent.Part.Color = Color3.new(1, 0, 0)
end

local function MakePartGreen()
    script.Parent.Part.Color = Color3.new(0.0470588, 1, 0)
end

-- This will make the part red, then change it to green.
wait(5)
MakePartRed()
wait(5)
MakePartGreen()
```
