## Intro

This page will go over basics that you will use every day when using RLua.
```lua
    -- Print something
    -- This will be visible in the output in Roblox Studio.
    -- Printing can be super useful for figuring out what's not working.
    print("hello!")

    -- Print something, but warning.
    -- This is the same as printing, but this time will be highlighed orange.
    warn("oh no!")

    -- Waiting. Extremely useful, will wait for a certain amount of time before doing something. 
    -- Will be used quite a lot.
    wait(2) -- Time in seconds (in-game: ticks)

    -- Variable. This can be a true-false, number, or even a string.
    -- Variables can't be named something roblox uses such as "function"

    -- Number
    local myVariable = 2

    -- Boolean (True-false)
    local myVarible2 = true

    -- String
    local myVarible3 = "hello"
```

Now for some more code, this section will go over functions, conditions, loops, if-else statments, how the roblox file system works, and how to change parts. <br>
<br>
**Defining a function** <br>
Creating functions are extremely useful for doing tasks. For example, let's say you want to print something, warn, and then run a big 'ol function. Not only will functions make your code easier to read, but they can even in some cases be faster.
```lua
-- Your function can be called whatever you want. Make sure it's name is relevent to what it does.
local function myfunction()

end -- Remember to include "end" Roblox will usually auto-fill this for you anyway.
```
**Using functions** <br>
Calling a function will be needed to run your function or functions. The next examples will go over ways you can use functions.

```lua
-- Simple function. Make sure to call it.
local function mePrintSomething()
    print("Hello function.")
end

-- Calling a function is easy. You could even add a wait before calling it!
mePrintSomething()
```

```lua
-- Multiple functions. With some other code.
local function printSomething()
    print("This is my other function. Say hi!")
    wait(5)
    warn("I don't like functions.")
end

local function wow()
    print("Not very nice. :c")
end

wait(2)
printSomething() -- Call your functions.
wait(3)
print("Woah I called my function!")
wow()
```

**Conditions & Loops** <br>
Sometimes you don't want your code to simply run. Instead only run when you *need* it to.
Or even have it run a bunch of times.

```lua
...

-- Conditions

-- Let's assume we have a function to call named "doSomething"
local run = false

-- using the if statement will make your code only runs if the condition is met.
if run == false then -- Make sure when you want "is equal to" use double equals.
    doSomething()
end

-- If-else statement. Just like an if, but with an else.
if run == false then
    doSomething()
else -- Else will run if run is equal to anything OTHER than (for example) false.
    print("Run!")
end
```

```lua
-- Loops


-- Your loop can be conditional, or it can run forever.

-- A conditional loop.
-- This will only loop while run is equal to false.
while run == false do
    wait(0.1) -- See warning.
    doSomething()
end

-- WARNING: Running a loop without some level of wait will CRASH YOUR CLIENT.

-- Infinite loop
-- nil means nothing. This will run forever.
while nil = true do
    wait(2)
    print("Waiting on you!")
end

```

**Roblox File Structure**  
The way roblox handles folders, parts, children and parents is quite easy.  
For these example, we'll be using a file structure as seen below.
